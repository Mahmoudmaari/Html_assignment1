            <h2><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong></h2>
            <p>What is Lorem Ipsum? </p>
            <article>
                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing
                    and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and</p>
                    <p> scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
                     survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                     electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
                     It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
                     sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with
                     desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
                      of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

            <p>Why do we use it?</p>
            <article>
                <p>
                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be 
                     distracted by the readable content of a page when 
                     looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum 
                     is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
                     letters, as opposed to using 'Content here,</p>
                     <p> 
                     making it look like readable English. Many
                     desktop publishing packages and web page editors
                     now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and
                     a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web
                     sites still in their infancy. Various versions have
                     evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,
                     sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
